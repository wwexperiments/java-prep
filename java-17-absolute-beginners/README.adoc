=== Building and Deploying

This is a Maven multi-module project. Build it from scratch using:
----
mvn clean install
----

Build it without tests using:
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

The default Maven goal is set to:
----
clean install site
----

This allows you to build the project and generate the site for it just by running `mvn`, at the root of the project.

If you want to generate and run the project site run
----
mvn clean install site site:stage site:run -Pdocs
----

This project does not require installing Apache Maven, because it was configured to be run with an Apache Maven Wrapper. All previous commands can be  run with `./mvnw` instead of `mvn`.

The `docs` maven profile excludes a few modules from generating docs, because of failures caused by non-modular dependencies and plugin incompatibilities.

==== Building using Docker

If you want to build the project using a Docker container, a Dockerfile is provided to you. Just build the image using the following command (the 5th step is Maven build):
----
docker build -t java-17-bgn .
----
If you want to inspect the image contents, run the container image using:
----
docker run -it -p 9000:9000 --name java-17-bgn-build -v ${PWD}:/usr/src/java-17-for-absolute-beginners java-17-bgn
----

Or if you are using a Linux/Unix system just execute the `build-and-serve.sh` provided with this project and the Docker image will be built, a container will be started and used to build the project and serve the docs at http://localhost:9000/. It might take a while, but it gets the job done.
